## How to use

In the values folder you will find the file "google_maps_api.xml", in here down below there is a String with the value "YOUR KEY"
here you need to key in your own Places API Key! Otherwise the Location Services won't work!

## Bugs
One known bug is that, when a picture is taken with the camera, it stores the picture as a thumbnail. I haven't managed to get the full-sized
picture back instead. I'll work on that issue once I've more knowledge.
